Arithmetic Operators
There are following arithmetic operators supported by PHP language −

Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then

Operator	Description                                                 Example
+           Adds two operands                                               A + B will give 30
-           Subtracts second operand from the first                         A - B will give -10
*           Multiply both operands                                          A * B will give 200
/           Divide numerator by de-numerator                                B / A will give 2
%           Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer division     B % A will give 0
++          Increment operator, increases integer value by one              A++ will give 11
--          Decrement operator, decreases integer value by one              A-- will give 9
