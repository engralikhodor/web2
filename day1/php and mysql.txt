What is MySQL? 
MySQL is a relational database management system based on SQL â€“ Structured Query Language.
The application is used for a wide range of purposes, including data warehousing, e-commerce, and logging applications.
The most common use for mySQL however, is for the purpose of a web database.

* Relational databases are structured. You have tables and these tables may have dependencies on each other, 
or relationships. A database for a store will have a table for customers and one for orders. 
These two tables are related, because an order is made by a customer.
* A relational database uses SQL which is short for Structured Query Language. This is a fairly rigid and standard way 
of storing data using tables, columns and rows. Columns represent the data point to be stored and a row represents 
a record with data points per column that has been defined. These are defined in a table which is usually 
atomic in nature; this means that a table should really only store data records on one entity or object at a time. 
Eg. A Table Customers should ONLY be storing customer records.
* When additional details are required, or data needs to be associated with a record from one table to another, 
then we have what we call relationships. A common key is established between the two (or more) tables and 
this is used for that association there after.
