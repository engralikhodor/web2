What is a web server?
A web server is server software, or hardware dedicated to running this software, 
that can satisfy client requests on the World Wide Web.
A web server can, in general, contain one or more websites.
A web server processes incoming network requests over HTTP and several other related protocols.

* HTTP is a generic and stateless protocol which can be used for other purposes as well using extensions
of its request methods, error codes, and headers. Basically, HTTP is a TCP/IP based communication protocol,
that is used to deliver data (HTML files, image files, query results, etc.) on the World Wide Web.
